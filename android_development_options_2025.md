# Android Development Alternatives in 2025

## Introduction

Android app development has traditionally relied on **Android Studio with Kotlin (or Java) and XML layouts**. By 2025, developers have many alternative approaches and frameworks to build Android apps. These range from modern native toolkits to cross-platform frameworks that allow sharing code across platforms. Below we detail major alternatives to the classic Kotlin+XML method, including their approach, tools/frameworks, recommended IDEs, and key characteristics.

## Kotlin with Jetpack Compose (Modern Android UI)

Jetpack Compose is **Android’s modern UI toolkit** for building native interfaces in Kotlin. Instead of XML layouts, the UI is defined in Kotlin code using declarative *@Composable* functions. This approach simplifies and accelerates UI development by allowing developers to write **less code with more expressive, intuitive APIs**. Google now recommends Jetpack Compose for new Android UI development, as it integrates seamlessly with Kotlin and Android Studio.

* **Language & Paradigm:** Uses **Kotlin** with a declarative UI paradigm. UI components are composed in code, making the UI logic and layout part of the same language (no separate XML files). This unified approach means **fewer context switches** between XML and Kotlin, and often results in **significantly less code** for equivalent screens.
* **Tooling & IDE:** **Android Studio** (Arctic Fox and later) fully supports Jetpack Compose. It provides Compose project templates, real-time previews, and interactive debugging tools specific to Compose. Developers use the standard Android toolchain (Gradle, Android SDK), with the Jetpack Compose libraries added.
* **Use Cases:** Ideal for **modern Android apps** and new projects aiming for faster development and cleaner UI code. Many teams adopt Compose when starting fresh or when refactoring legacy UIs to a more maintainable form. Compose is also used alongside existing XML UIs (you can mix Compose and traditional views gradually).
* **Benefits:** Compose greatly **reduces boilerplate** and can speed up UI development. Developers report focusing more on app features rather than writing/referencing XML, since “it’s much easier to trace through code when it’s all in one place rather than jumping between Kotlin and XML”. Hot-reload and live previews in Android Studio let developers instantly see changes, further boosting productivity. In fact, some teams have seen up to **3× faster development speed** after migrating to Compose. Google notes that as of early 2024 there were **125,000+ Play Store apps using Jetpack Compose**, reflecting rapid adoption.
* **Considerations:** There is a learning curve for developers used to the old View system, and Compose being Kotlin-only means **Java-only projects must adopt Kotlin** to use it. However, Compose interops with existing code and views, and its **official documentation and samples** are extensive (part of Android’s documentation, with many codelabs and tutorials). Community support is strong and growing, given that over **23% of the top 1000 Android apps** already included Compose by 2023 (more than double the previous year).

## Java-based Android Development (Traditional Approach)

Java was the original language for Android development and remains a supported option in 2025. Developers can use **Android Studio with Java** to write app logic, paired with XML layouts for UI (the classic Android UI approach). This approach benefits from a large legacy knowledge base and stability, though Google’s shift to Kotlin means new examples are often Kotlin-first.

* **Language & Framework:** Uses **Java** with the standard Android SDK and XML layout files. The app architecture (Activities, Fragments, etc.) is the same as with Kotlin, just written in Java.
* **Tooling & IDE:** **Android Studio** is the recommended IDE for Java as well. It provides full code editing, debugging, and design tools for Java projects. All Android SDK features (and Jetpack libraries) are accessible in Java, and Google continues to provide Java versions of most of its documentation and libraries, though Kotlin is emphasized.
* **Use Cases:** Primarily for **legacy projects** and teams heavily invested in Java. Companies with large existing codebases in Java may continue with it for consistency. Also, some developers who are experts in Java or need maximum compatibility with certain libraries might choose Java.
* **Advantages:** Java is a **tried-and-true, widely understood language** for enterprise development. It has a vast ecosystem of libraries and a decade’s worth of community knowledge for Android. Tools like Android Studio’s UI designer and Gradle build system were originally built with Java in mind, so Java integrates very smoothly. Java’s long-term stability and backward compatibility can be an asset in long-running projects.
* **Trade-offs:** Compared to Kotlin, Java can be **more verbose** and lacks modern language conveniences, which means more boilerplate code and potential for null-pointer errors (Kotlin reduces these with null-safety). Development can be slightly slower due to this extra boilerplate and less concise syntax. In fact, by 2023 over 95% of the top 1000 Android apps use Kotlin and only \~25% of professional Android developers still use Java as their primary language. This indicates that while Java expertise is still relevant, the **momentum has shifted to Kotlin** for most new Android development.
* **Support & Community:** Java is still officially supported by Google for Android (it’s one of the two primary languages, alongside Kotlin). **Official documentation and libraries** often have Java versions (or at least interoperability), and Android Studio fully supports Java code. The **community** for Java in Android is enormous given Android’s history – countless Stack Overflow Q\&A, blogs, and books cover Android Java development. However, since new libraries and samples are now Kotlin-first, Java developers might sometimes need to translate from Kotlin samples. There are no licensing costs – Java development in Android Studio is free and cross-platform (Studio runs on Windows, Mac, Linux).

## Android Development with C++ (NDK and C++ Frameworks)

Using C++ for Android app development is an alternative when performance or reuse of native code is critical. Android’s **Native Development Kit (NDK)** allows C/C++ code to be compiled into native libraries that your app can use, typically for CPU-intensive tasks or to integrate existing C/C++ code (like game engines or signal processing libraries). In some cases, entire apps (especially games or engine-based apps) are written in C++ with only a small Java/Kotlin layer to launch them.

* **Language & Approach:** Uses **C++** (and optionally C) for implementing app functionality. Standard Android apps can include C++ code via the NDK, usually accessed through Java/Kotlin via JNI (Java Native Interface). Alternatively, frameworks like **Qt** or game engines (Unreal, cocos2d-x, etc.) let you write the bulk of the app in C++ and cross-compile to Android. This approach is often employed for **high-performance needs**: C++ offers more control over memory and can execute heavy computations faster than managed languages.
* **Recommended IDE:** C++ Android development can be done in **Android Studio** (which has NDK support, CMake build integration, and debugging for C++). Android Studio allows creating “Native C++” app projects, and you can step through C++ code with the debugger. Another option is **Microsoft Visual Studio** (with the Mobile Development with C++ workload) on Windows – it can deploy and debug C++ on Android devices using the NDK toolchain. For cross-platform C++ frameworks like Qt, the **Qt Creator** IDE is often used. Many game developers also use **Visual Studio Code** or other editors with command-line builds for NDK projects.
* **Use Cases:** Suitable for scenarios where **performance is paramount** or a **common C++ codebase** is shared across platforms. Common examples include games (which often use C++ engines), apps doing heavy image/audio processing or AR/VR, and apps ported from other platforms that have existing C++ code. C++ might also be used to write low-level libraries that are used by a Kotlin/Java UI.
* **Benefits:** C++ can deliver **native performance** and efficient memory management. It’s closer to the hardware, which is useful for computationally intensive tasks (rendering, physics simulations, encryption, etc.). It also enables code reuse across different platforms (e.g., sharing core logic between an Android app and a Windows/Linux app). The NDK provides libraries and support for C++17 (and above) features, and you can tap into a wealth of existing C/C++ libraries for things like game development, audio processing, or database engines.
* **Challenges:** Pure C++ development for typical app UI is **complex and not commonly done**. The Android UI toolkit is not directly available in C++, so you either create UI in Java/Kotlin and only use C++ for logic, or use a cross-platform UI framework (which might not feel fully “Android-native”). Debugging and tooling are a bit more involved – for example, setting up breakpoints in C++ and ensuring the native libs are packaged correctly. **Developer productivity can be lower** due to manual memory management and lack of high-level conveniences. Google’s tooling and documentation for the NDK exist, but are not as extensive as for Kotlin/Java. So while C++ is **supported** on Android, it is typically reserved for “niche” portions of apps rather than entire conventional apps. Developers also need to manage JNI interoperability if mixing with Java, which adds complexity.
* **Community & Support:** The community of Android NDK/C++ developers is relatively **small** compared to Kotlin/Java. You’ll find resources in communities like game development forums or the AOSP (Android Open Source Project) discussions, but general app development questions in C++ are less common. Official support is limited to low-level documentation of NDK APIs. Overall, this alternative is powerful but aimed at advanced use cases – for a typical app that can be written in Kotlin/Java, using C++ would be an unnecessary complication. It shines when you truly need that extra performance or are bringing a lot of pre-existing C++ code into Android.

## Flutter with Dart

**Flutter** is a popular cross-platform UI toolkit from Google that enables developers to build Android and iOS apps (and even web and desktop) from a single codebase. Flutter applications are written in the **Dart language** and use Flutter’s rich set of widgets for the UI. Unlike traditional Android apps that use native UI components, Flutter renders its UI using a high-performance rendering engine (Skia) for a consistent look-and-feel across platforms.

* **Approach & Technology:** Uses **Dart** language and Flutter’s reactive framework. The UI is built by composing **widgets** in Dart code, which Flutter then renders to a canvas. This means the app UI is the same on Android and iOS (with the ability to adapt styling to each, e.g., Material Design on Android, Cupertino style on iOS, if desired). Flutter apps are ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled to native ARM code for release, which gives near-native performance. Development is aided by an efficient **hot reload** feature that lets you inject code changes into a running app and see the results in real time, greatly speeding up the coding/testing cycle.
* **Tools & IDE:** Flutter has an independent SDK that you install alongside the Dart SDK. **Visual Studio Code** with the Flutter extension is a very popular setup due to its lightweight nature and fast workflows. **Android Studio/IntelliJ IDEA** is another recommended IDE – Google provides plugins for both VS Code and IntelliJ/Android Studio for full Flutter support (widget autocompletion, visual UI inspector, debugger, etc.). Flutter’s own command-line tools (`flutter` command) manage running, building, and deploying apps to devices or emulators. The choice of IDE comes down to preference; both are officially supported and free.
* **Use Cases:** Flutter is ideal when you need to develop **cross-platform mobile apps quickly** without maintaining separate Android and iOS codebases. Startups and teams that want to launch on both platforms simultaneously often choose Flutter to reduce development effort. It’s also great for apps that require a custom-designed UI or consistent brand identity across platforms, because Flutter’s rendering gives you complete control over every pixel (at the cost of not using native UI controls by default). Flutter is used in a wide range of apps, from simple MVPs to large-scale apps by companies like Alibaba and Google (e.g., parts of Google Pay are built with Flutter). It’s also expanding to web and desktop, making it a potential choice for an **all-in-one solution** for multi-platform application needs.
* **Development Speed & Ease:** Flutter is generally praised for its **fast development cycle**. The combination of hot-reload and a declarative UI allows developers to iterate UI/UX quickly. Dart is an easy language to pick up (familiar to anyone with JavaScript/Java/C# experience) and was designed for developer productivity. The Flutter framework includes ready-made widgets for Material and Cupertino design languages, so you can achieve native-looking apps without a lot of custom code. **Learning Flutter** is straightforward thanks to extensive official documentation, examples, and an active community. Many developers report that productivity in Flutter is as good as, or better than, native development due to the streamlined workflow.
* **Performance & Considerations:** Flutter apps run at native-like speed (they can reach 60fps or 120fps UIs) because they’re compiled to native code and don’t rely on a JavaScript bridge (unlike some other cross-platform solutions). However, the app binaries tend to be larger, and because Flutter bundles its own engine and widgets, the **initial app size** is a bit bigger than a minimal native app. Also, while Flutter can access native device APIs via platform channels, you might sometimes need to write platform-specific code (in Kotlin/Swift) if a plugin for a certain feature isn’t available. The Flutter ecosystem is very rich though, with thousands of packages on pub.dev for everything from Firebase integration to image processing.
* **Community & Popularity:** Flutter has a massive and active community. Google continues to invest heavily in it (regular releases, Flutter events, etc.), and as of May 2023 **over one million apps** had been published with Flutter. In developer surveys, Flutter is consistently one of the top cross-platform frameworks, often neck-and-neck with React Native in popularity. Both new and experienced developers can find plenty of resources – from official docs to YouTube tutorials – and issues are frequently discussed (and solved) on forums. Being open-source, Flutter itself is actively improved by contributions. Overall, Flutter in 2025 is a mature and widely adopted alternative for Android development, especially when cross-platform support is a priority.

## React Native for Android Development

**React Native** is another leading cross-platform framework, created by Facebook (Meta) and first released in 2015. It allows developers to build mobile apps using **JavaScript or TypeScript**, with a programming model based on React (a popular web library). In React Native, the UI components you define in JavaScript are backed by real native controls on the device. This means the framework bridges the JS code to native code – giving you a native look and feel – while letting you write the logic using React’s component and state concepts.

* **Approach & Technology:** Uses **JavaScript** (or TypeScript) and the **React paradigm** (“learn once, write anywhere”). You build UI by declaring React components (using JSX syntax) that describe what the UI should look like. Under the hood, React Native maps these to Android Views and iOS UIView equivalents. A React Native app includes a JavaScript runtime (for Android, it’s usually Hermes or JSC engine) that runs the JS code. **Updates to the UI are fast** thanks to React’s diffing algorithm – the JS code sends changes to the native layer via a bridge. Modern versions of React Native (with the new Fabric architecture and TurboModules) have improved performance by reducing overhead in this communication.
* **Tools & IDE:** React Native development requires setting up Node.js and typically **VS Code** is the go-to editor for most JS developers. VS Code, with its rich ecosystem of extensions, provides a great environment for React Native (syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, etc.). There’s also **Expo**, a toolkit/CLI that streamlines React Native development by providing a managed app shell – with Expo, you can even start without Android Studio, testing on a device with the Expo Go app. However, to do more advanced native modules or to deploy to app stores, the **Android Studio** SDK/Emulator setup is needed eventually (for building the Android binary). There isn’t a single “official” IDE; web-oriented IDEs/editors like VS Code or WebStorm are popular, and Android Studio can be used primarily to run emulators or inspect Android-specific issues.
* **Use Cases:** Great for teams with **web development expertise** or existing React web code, since they can reuse knowledge (and sometimes code) between web and mobile. Many companies choose React Native to **share code across platforms** – you can write most of your app in JS and have it run on Android and iOS. It’s particularly favored for apps with simpler native UI requirements or those that want to deliver a consistent experience on both platforms quickly. Examples of apps built with React Native include Facebook’s own products (like the Facebook app and Instagram, which have RN components), **Discord** (the chat app uses React Native on mobile), Tesla, Shopify, and many others. It’s proven at scale in production apps.
* **Developer Experience:** React Native offers **fast refresh** (similar to hot reload) that lets you see code changes almost instantly during development. This speeds up the development process significantly, as you don’t need to recompile the entire app for most changes. The programming model is declarative (like Flutter and Compose) but using React/JSX, which many developers find intuitive, especially if coming from web React. One of the biggest advantages is the **huge collection of libraries**: if your app needs a certain feature, there’s likely an npm package or React Native module for it (e.g., camera access, maps, etc.). The flip side is that you sometimes need to handle native modules or write native code for features that aren’t covered by existing packages, meaning React Native developers benefit from at least familiarity with Android/iOS native code.
* **Performance & Considerations:** React Native’s performance is generally good for most application use-cases, but because it runs JavaScript on a separate thread and communicates over a bridge, extremely graphics-intensive or computationally-heavy tasks can be challenging. For example, games or 3D graphics are not suited to RN (those are better with Unity or native code). However, typical **UI-centric apps (lists, navigation, API calls)** perform fine and feel native. The new architecture (Fabric) in recent React Native versions has further closed the performance gap. Another consideration is app size – including a JS engine adds some overhead, but it’s not huge (often on par with Flutter’s engine overhead). **Official support** comes from Open Source: Meta maintains the project and there’s extensive documentation on the React Native website. The community has also created tools like Ignite (project boilerplates) and countless tutorials.
* **Community & Popularity:** React Native has one of the **largest communities** in the mobile dev world. Being around longer than Flutter, it has a mature ecosystem. There are meetups, conferences, and a dedicated Stack Overflow presence. In 2025, React Native continues to be extremely popular – it often ranks alongside Flutter in surveys of cross-platform frameworks (some surveys show Flutter slightly ahead among all devs, but React Native still slightly preferred by professional devs). Its popularity is buoyed by the massive number of web developers learning mobile via RN. Choosing between React Native and Flutter often comes down to team background (JavaScript vs Dart) and specific project needs, not a clear winner in capability. Both are free and allow targeting Android, iOS (and with React Native, you can also target Windows/macOS via community extensions). **In summary**, React Native is a powerful alternative for Android development in 2025, especially if you want to leverage web technologies and still deliver a native app.

## .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI with C#)

**.NET MAUI** is Microsoft’s modern cross-platform framework for building native apps using C# and .NET. Introduced as the successor to Xamarin.Forms, .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) allows developers to write a **single C# codebase** that targets Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS. In 2025, .NET MAUI is a prime option for C# developers or teams with .NET expertise to create Android apps (often alongside other platform targets) without learning new languages or maintaining separate projects per platform.

* **Approach:** Uses **C# and XAML** (or C# fluent APIs) for UI and app logic, leveraging the .NET platform. .NET MAUI is essentially an abstraction over the native UI frameworks: for example, a MAUI `Button` will render as an Android `Button` on Android and an iOS `UIButton` on iOS. This **one framework** handles multiple platforms, built on top of the latest .NET runtime. Apps are compiled to native binaries (e.g., using Mono/AOT for iOS, and just-in-time with ahead-of-time bits for Android). The framework unifies project structure – in MAUI you have one single project that can produce platform-specific binaries.
* **Recommended IDE:** **Visual Studio 2022** is the primary IDE for .NET MAUI development. On Windows, VS 2022 (v17.3 and later) has full MAUI support, including Android emulators, iOS simulators (via networked Mac or Hot Restart), and XAML IntelliSense/designers. Microsoft provides MAUI project templates in Visual Studio to get started quickly. On macOS, developers historically used **Visual Studio for Mac**, but that product is being retired in 2024. As an alternative, developers can use Visual Studio Code or JetBrains Rider on Mac/Linux with the .NET CLI for MAUI, but those setups are more involved. In general, **Windows is the most straightforward environment** for MAUI development (especially if targeting iOS via a Mac build agent).
* **Use Cases:** .NET MAUI is a top choice for **organizations or developers with a strong .NET background**. If you have existing C# code (perhaps business logic from a backend or a previous Xamarin app), you can reuse parts of it. MAUI is also useful if you want to target **desktop in addition to mobile** – for example, you can build an app that runs on Android phones and Windows PC from largely the same code. This makes MAUI unique compared to some other frameworks that focus only on mobile. Common scenarios include enterprise apps where the team is already using Microsoft’s ecosystem, or any case where one wants to **maintain a single codebase for Android, iOS, and Windows**.
* **Advantages:** Developers can write in **one of the world’s most popular enterprise languages (C#)** and use the rich .NET libraries. MAUI provides access to native device APIs through a unified API (for instance, accessing sensors or contacts is done via .NET MAUI Essentials library, which under the hood calls the native Android/iOS APIs). The **productivity is high** for those familiar with tools like XAML and MVVM patterns – features like XAML Hot Reload and .NET Hot Restart allow iterative building of the UI without full rebuilds. Being backed by Microsoft, MAUI has strong official support: excellent **documentation and learning resources** (Microsoft Learn, docs, and an active team developing it). It’s also open source and continues to receive improvements. Another plus is integration with the broader .NET ecosystem – you can easily use libraries for networking (System.Net), databases (Entity Framework or SQLite libraries), and even build **Blazor Hybrid** apps (where you write web UI in C# Razor and host it in a MAUI app).
* **Considerations:** .NET MAUI in 2025 is still **relatively new** (GA released in mid-2022). It has matured with .NET 7 and .NET 8 releases, but some developers encountered growing pains like Android build performance issues or needing to wait for third-party controls to get MAUI support. The community, while benefiting from former Xamarin developers, is smaller than those of Flutter or React Native. However, it’s growing fast – by 2025, with Xamarin support ended, most of the Xamarin user base has migrated or is migrating to MAUI. Microsoft officially ended support for Xamarin as of May 2024, solidifying MAUI as the path forward. Another consideration: to target iOS with .NET MAUI, you still need a Mac (for the Apple build tools) accessible to your development environment. This is similar to other cross-platform tools but worth noting for teams on Windows. In terms of **performance**, MAUI apps are fully native (there isn’t a scripting layer at runtime like React Native’s JS bridge). They may have a slight startup overhead due to the .NET runtime, but runtime performance is very close to native. In fact, MAUI uses the latest .NET which is **faster than the old Mono runtime of Xamarin**, leading to quicker startup and smoother execution.
* **Community & Popularity:** The official support from Microsoft and the existing .NET community make MAUI’s learning materials and libraries robust, but the broader mobile dev community awareness is still catching up. Many C# developers have embraced MAUI – by 2025, an estimated **85% of new .NET mobile apps are using .NET MAUI** (with Xamarin effectively retired). There are active forums (e.g., Microsoft Q\&A, Reddit’s r/dotnetMAUI) and libraries like Telerik and DevExpress providing UI controls for MAUI. **Cost-wise**, MAUI itself is free and part of the open-source .NET platform. Developing with Visual Studio Community Edition is free for individuals and small companies, though larger enterprises might need a Visual Studio Professional/Enterprise license. Overall, .NET MAUI is a compelling alternative for Android development in 2025, especially for those who want **one codebase across mobile and desktop** or who come from a C# background.

## Xamarin (Xamarin.Android & Xamarin.Forms – Legacy)

**Xamarin** refers to the older Xamarin platform (acquired by Microsoft, now integrated into .NET) that allowed C# development for Android and iOS. Xamarin comes in two flavors: **Xamarin.Android** (and Xamarin.iOS), which are essentially C# wrappers around the native APIs (one could write Android apps in C# similar to Java, designing UIs in AXML or code), and **Xamarin.Forms**, a higher-level framework that introduced a shared XAML UI across platforms. In 2025, Xamarin is considered a **legacy alternative**, as it has been superseded by .NET MAUI. However, it’s worth mentioning because many apps built in the 2015–2021 era used Xamarin, and developers maintaining those will recognize it as an alternative approach.

* **Approach:** Uses **C#** and the Mono runtime to run on Android. A Xamarin.Android project is structured similarly to a traditional Android project but in C#: you write Activities in C#, and you can either use Android XML layouts or Xamarin’s own markup. Xamarin.Forms (released later) allowed defining a **single UI in XAML** and sharing it between Android, iOS, etc., with the framework rendering native controls under the hood (much like MAUI does now). Essentially, Xamarin.Forms was the precursor to MAUI, offering a unified UI layer on top of Xamarin.Android/iOS.
* **Tools & IDE:** Xamarin development was done in **Visual Studio** (or Visual Studio for Mac). Microsoft integrated Xamarin tools into Visual Studio after acquiring Xamarin. Developers would install the Xamarin workload to get templates for Android/iOS apps in C#. Xamarin projects used the **SDK style projects** in later versions, and debugging could be done on device or emulator similarly to native. In 2025, while Xamarin is no longer supported, Visual Studio 2022 can still load and build Xamarin projects (for now), but new project templates encourage MAUI.
* **Use Cases:** Historically, Xamarin was used by developers who wanted to **use C# across mobile platforms**, often to share code with a server or other .NET code. Xamarin.Android was also used by some because C# could offer some nicer features than Java (pre-Kotlin), like LINQ or better async constructs. Xamarin.Forms targeted those who wanted maximum UI/code sharing between Android and iOS, albeit with some trade-offs in customizability. In the present, one might continue using Xamarin only to **maintain an existing app** that hasn’t migrated to MAUI yet. New projects in 2025 are **not recommended** on Xamarin due to its end-of-life status.
* **Pros (Legacy):** Before MAUI, Xamarin was a **mature ecosystem** with many plugins (e.g., for ads, analytics, etc.) and a strong community of XAML/C# developers. It allowed significant code sharing – often one could share the entire business logic layer and just have small platform-specific parts. Xamarin apps are truly native (using native UI controls and performance similar to native apps). For companies already in the Microsoft stack, Xamarin was a natural way to go mobile without learning Java/Kotlin/Swift.
* **Cons:** Xamarin technology had some drawbacks that MAUI aimed to solve. For example, Xamarin.Forms needed separate rendering implementations for each platform which sometimes lagged in offering the latest UI features. Developers often had to write **platform-specific tweaks** or custom renderers for a truly polished UI. Build times and app package sizes were also sometimes criticized (though this improved over time). By 2024, the biggest con is simply that **Xamarin is no longer being updated or supported**. Microsoft announced end of support for all Xamarin SDKs (Android, iOS, Forms) as of May 1, 2024. That means no new features, no updates for new OS versions beyond that point (Xamarin targets Android 13 / API level 33 as final). Apps still using Xamarin should plan to migrate to .NET MAUI for long-term support.
* **Community & Transition:** The Xamarin community has largely transitioned to MAUI. Resources for Xamarin still exist (Xamarin forums archives, documentation archived by Microsoft, etc.), and a lot of the know-how applies to MAUI. If you are dealing with a Xamarin app in 2025, Microsoft provides migration guides to help move it to MAUI. **In summary**, Xamarin served as a bridge for C# developers to do Android development, and its spirit lives on in MAUI. But as an alternative in 2025, it’s only relevant for maintaining legacy apps – for any new development, MAUI should be chosen instead.

## Comparison of Android Development Approaches

The table below compares the above options (including the traditional Kotlin+XML method) across several dimensions:

| **Approach**                      | **Typical Use Case**                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | **Ease of Development**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | **Speed of Development**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | **Developer Support** (Official)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Community Support**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | **Popularity (2025)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Costs**                                                                                                                                                                  | **Dev Platforms (IDE)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| **Kotlin + XML** (Android Studio) | Native Android apps (single-platform); widely used in legacy and existing apps that use XML layouts.                                                                                                                                       | Moderate – well-documented but involves separate XML and Kotlin files. Lots of boilerplate (XML inflation, view binding) compared to newer methods.                                                                                                                                                                                    | Moderate – UI changes require rebuild/deploy (XML layouts can be previewed, but iterative UI development is slower than with Compose).                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Excellent official support (Google’s original standard; extensive docs, tools, and stability).                                                                                                                                                                                            | Vast community (over a decade of Q\&A, libraries, tutorials). Many resources for solving issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Still common in existing projects, but new projects mostly Kotlin+Compose. Kotlin is now the primary Android language (used by >50% of devs, vs \~25% for Java). XML layouts remain supported, though Compose is rising.                                                                                                           | Free (Android Studio + SDK are free).                                                                                                                                      | Android Studio runs on Windows, macOS, Linux.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Kotlin + Jetpack Compose**      | Modern Android UI development; new apps or major refactor projects aiming for faster development and cleaner UI code.                                                                                                                      | High – declarative Kotlin UI is intuitive with less code. Single language (no XML) makes maintenance easier. Initial learning curve if coming from XML, but well-designed APIs.                                                                                                                                                        | Fast – hot previews and declarative updates allow quick UI iteration. Compose reduces code by significant amounts, speeding up feature development (some teams saw \~3× faster UI development).                                                                                                                                                     | Excellent official support (Google’s recommended toolkit for UI; many samples, Compose integrations in Android Studio).                                                                                                                                                                   | Rapidly growing community; lots of new libraries, Jetpack Compose snippets, and blogs. Already 125k+ apps using Compose on Play Store, adoption doubling yearly in top apps.                                                                                                                                      | Increasing adoption – by 2025, Compose is mainstream for new Android UIs (around 23% of top apps in 2023, and climbing). Expected to eventually replace XML layouts as default.                                                                                                                                                    | Free (Android Studio and Compose libs).                                                                                                                                    | Android Studio on Win/Mac/Linux (Compose supported in recent versions).                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Java + XML** (Android Studio)   | Legacy Android development; maintaining existing Java-based apps or for devs who prefer Java. Some enterprise apps still use Java.                                                                                                         | Moderate – strong typing and well-known language, but more verbose code than Kotlin. Lacks modern conveniences (e.g. extension functions), so more boilerplate and potential for null errors.                                                                                                                                          | Slower than Kotlin – more lines of code to write and manage. No language-level coroutines (uses older concurrency libraries). Development speed is otherwise similar to Kotlin+XML (traditional edit-compile-run cycle).                                                                                                                            | Full official support (Android’s original language; Google provides documentation in Java too, though new docs are Kotlin-first). Tools (Android Studio, debuggers) work equally well for Java.                                                                                           | Large, but diminishing, community. Years of knowledge base to draw on. However, many communities have shifted focus to Kotlin, so Java questions are answered but fewer new Java-centric libraries are created now.                                                                                               | Declining – Kotlin has overtaken it as the preferred Android language. \~25% of Android developers still primarily use Java, and many codebases remain in Java, but new projects are overwhelmingly Kotlin-first.                                                                                                                  | Free (Android Studio, etc.).                                                                                                                                               | Android Studio on Windows, macOS, Linux.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **C++ (Android NDK / Qt)**        | Specialized use: performance-critical components, game development, or reuse of existing C++ libraries. Often used for native libraries within a Kotlin/Java app or for game engines running on Android.                                   | Low for general app dev – significantly more complex. Memory management and JNI bridging make pure C++ apps challenging. Easier if using a framework (Qt, Unreal) but then one must learn those frameworks.                                                                                                                            | Slower development iteration for UI (no native UI toolkit in C++ by default – need to recompile for changes, or use framework-specific hot reload if available). Logic development can be fast for those proficient in C++, but overall app dev is slower compared to using higher-level languages.                                                 | Limited official support – Google provides the NDK, documentation and sample code for native APIs, but C++ is not the primary focus of Android tooling. Less out-of-the-box support in Android Studio (no visual UI designer for C++).                                                    | Niche community. Game developers and engine developers have communities (Unreal, Cocos2d, etc.), and there are NDK-specific forums. Far fewer generic “Android C++” resources than for Kotlin/Java.                                                                                                               | Niche popularity – only used in specific domains (games, high-performance apps). Not common for standard app development in 2025. Most apps use C++ only for certain modules if at all.                                                                                                                                            | Free – NDK is free; Android Studio or Visual Studio Community are free. (Visual Studio paid versions needed in large enterprises if using VS).                             | Android Studio (all OS) with NDK/CMake. Visual Studio 2022 (Windows) supports C++ cross-platform dev. Qt Creator for Qt-based approach.                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Flutter + Dart**                | Cross-platform mobile apps (Android/iOS from one codebase). Ideal for startup apps, apps with custom UI/graphics, and projects aiming for feature parity on Android and iOS simultaneously. Also used for web and desktop targets by some. | High – Flutter is developer-friendly. Dart is easy to learn; Flutter’s widget library is comprehensive. The declarative UI and abundance of premade widgets make it straightforward to build complex UIs. Hot reload provides immediate feedback.                                                                                      | Very fast – **hot reload** allows sub-second update cycles, minimizing wait times. One codebase means features are developed once for both Android and iOS, greatly accelerating development for multi-platform apps.                                                                                                                               | Strong official support from Google (extensive documentation, regular releases, official packages). Tooling is well-integrated with VS Code and Android Studio. Flutter SDK includes testing, devtools, and a rich framework.                                                             | Huge community. Flutter has a vibrant ecosystem (packages on pub.dev for almost anything). Active Discord, Stack Overflow, meetups, and conferences. Over a million apps used Flutter by 2023, and the community continues to grow.                                                                               | Very high – One of the top cross-platform frameworks in 2025 (often ranked **#1 or #2** alongside React Native). Widely adopted across industries, with strong momentum (Flutter usage in apps and surveys grew rapidly through 2020s).                                                                                            | Free and open source. No licensing costs. Development tools (VS Code, Android Studio) are free.                                                                            | Development on Windows, macOS, or Linux. (Flutter supports all major OS for development.) VS Code or Android Studio/IntelliJ used as IDE with Flutter plugins.                                                                                                                                |
| **React Native** (JavaScript/TS)  | Cross-platform apps where web development talent is being leveraged for mobile. Great for apps that need to release on both Android and iOS quickly, especially if sharing code with a web app or if the team knows React.                 | High – if familiar with React/JS. Allows rapid UI development using familiar web-like syntax. However, purely native features may require some bridging/native code, which is an extra consideration (though many plugins exist). Overall developer experience is good, with fast refresh and a huge number of libraries.              | Fast – **Fast Refresh** enables quick iterations. Development speed is boosted by reusing code across platforms (and sometimes web). For most app features, you only write code once. Some extra time might be needed for optimizing performance or dealing with platform-specific nuances, but still faster than writing two separate native apps. | Good official support. Maintained by Meta and open-source contributors. Documentation is decent on the official site and improving. The React Native CLI and Expo CLI are provided for development. Not as structured as Google’s or Microsoft’s docs, but sufficient for most needs.     | Very large community. Second only to perhaps native Android/iOS communities. Thousands of third-party plugins (via npm), lots of tutorials, and Q\&A. Active community projects (Expo, React Native Navigation, etc.). You can often find answers to issues on GitHub or Stack Overflow given the huge user base. | Very high – still a **leading framework** for mobile dev. While Flutter has surged, React Native remains extremely popular (close usage stats between the two). Many big companies rely on RN; in 2025 it’s a proven technology with a stable presence.                                                                            | Free and open source. No fees. (Using React Native may involve Node.js tools, which are free. Expo has some paid services but core is free.)                               | Development on Windows, macOS, Linux all supported. (Building for iOS requires a Mac, but Android can be done on any OS.) Commonly used with VS Code or any JS editor; Android Studio used for emulator/SDK setup.                                                                            |
| **.NET MAUI** (C#/.NET)           | Cross-platform native apps in C#. Suited for teams with .NET expertise, apps that target Android + iOS + Windows from one codebase, and those upgrading from Xamarin. Enterprise apps and internal business apps often fit here.           | Moderate/High – easy for C# developers. XAML UI and MVVM patterns are well-established (though new devs might need to learn XAML). Having one project for multiple platforms simplifies development. The framework is still evolving, so occasionally one might hit a snag needing a workaround, but overall dev productivity is good. | Fast for multi-platform development – write once for multiple targets. XAML Hot Reload and .NET Hot Restart make UI tweaking quick. Build times have improved vs older Xamarin. For a single-platform Android app, speed is similar to native; for cross-platform projects, total dev time is greatly reduced.                                      | Excellent official support from Microsoft. Comprehensive documentation on Microsoft Learn, official samples, and an active development team. Visual Studio offers integrated designers, debugging, and templates. Long-term support (LTS releases of .NET) gives confidence in stability. | Growing community. Ex-Xamarin community has moved to MAUI, plus new developers from the .NET world. NuGet packages are adding MAUI support rapidly. Still smaller than Flutter/RN communities, but quite supportive and backed by enterprise developers.                                                          | Rising – quickly becoming standard for .NET mobile. With Xamarin discontinued, MAUI adoption in 2023-2025 has grown (estimated 85%+ of new .NET mobile apps use MAUI). Outside the .NET ecosystem, its overall mobile market share is smaller, but it’s increasingly recognized as a strong option for cross-platform development. | Free framework (open-source .NET). Visual Studio Community is free for individual developers and small companies; larger orgs may need a paid VS license. No runtime fees. | Primarily Windows (Visual Studio 2022) for full IDE support. Mac can be used via CLI or Rider, but VS Mac is deprecated. (Building for iOS requires Mac access, e.g., a networked Mac or MacinCloud, for the Apple toolchain.) Android development with MAUI can be done entirely on Windows. |
| **Xamarin** (C# – Legacy)         | Legacy C# cross-platform development. Used for maintaining existing apps built with Xamarin.Android or Xamarin.Forms. Not recommended for new projects in 2025.                                                                            | Moderate – same language (C#) as MAUI, but tooling is older. Xamarin.Forms had a decent UI abstraction but required workarounds for some native features. Developing in Xamarin.Android (platform-specific) is similar to Java Android dev in difficulty, just in C#.                                                                  | Moderate/Slow – productive in its time, but compared to newer tools, iteration was slower (e.g., no unified single-project, and hot reload was less advanced). Cross-platform sharing was good but often required writing platform-specific renderers. Overall development of new features now better handled in MAUI.                              | Official support **ended in May 2024**. During its life, it had solid support from Microsoft, but now there are no new updates. Documentation exists but is archived. Developers must rely on old docs and community knowledge for Xamarin.                                               | Once had a strong community (Xamarin University, forums, etc.), now mostly migrated to MAUI. Community support still exists in forums/Q\&A for legacy issues, but dwindling over time.                                                                                                                            | Low – effectively deprecated. Xamarin technology usage is dropping as projects migrate. By 2025, virtually all new development has shifted to MAUI or other frameworks. Xamarin is referenced only in context of legacy systems.                                                                                                   | Free (Xamarin was open source under .NET). Same situation with Visual Studio licensing as MAUI. No cost to use, but no future updates either.                              | Windows with Visual Studio (2019 or 2022) and macOS with Visual Studio for Mac (supported through 2023). Beyond 2024, developers should port to MAUI to use current tools/IDE support.                                                                                                        |

## Conclusion

In 2025, Android developers can choose from a rich array of development approaches, each with its pros and cons. **Traditional Kotlin + XML** remains a stable choice for pure native Android apps – it offers maximal control and a vast ecosystem, but involves more boilerplate and slower UI development compared to newer methods. Its strength is the maturity and depth of resources available; it’s a solid choice if you’re maintaining an existing app or have a team already proficient in Android’s classic techniques. However, for new projects, Google’s push toward **Kotlin + Jetpack Compose** makes the modern Compose approach very attractive. Compose’s pros include a **high development speed**, cleaner code (no XML separation), and growing community adoption. It’s ideal for Android-focused teams who want the latest and greatest in native UI. The main cons are the learning curve for those used to the old paradigm, though the long-term payoff in productivity is significant.

When performance is a critical concern or you need to use **native C++ libraries**, using **C++ with the Android NDK** is an option. The clear pro here is **maximum performance and native integration** – you can squeeze out more speed and even reuse code from other platforms. But the cons are heavy: development is more complex and slower, and it’s generally not recommended unless necessary. For the vast majority of app projects, higher-level alternatives will be more efficient for the developers.

On the cross-platform front, **Flutter** and **React Native** stand out as the two most popular choices in 2025. **Flutter’s** advantages are its fast development cycle (thanks to hot reload) and a single codebase that produces a consistent UI on Android and iOS. It’s great for beautifully designed apps and for teams starting from scratch who want to hit multiple platforms – you’ll benefit from a unified language (Dart) and a comprehensive toolkit. A con to consider is that Flutter apps don’t use native UI components, so if adhering to very platform-specific UI conventions is a priority, you may need extra work (though Flutter can mimic native styles). Also, Flutter adds an engine overhead, meaning app bundle sizes are a bit larger. **React Native’s** pros include leveraging web development skills (using React/JavaScript) and using native components under the hood, which can give a truly native look and feel. It’s highly suitable for teams that want to share code between web and mobile or those with existing React expertise. React Native’s cons involve the complexity of bridging between JavaScript and native – occasionally, performance tuning or writing native modules is needed for advanced use cases, which can complicate the project. Both Flutter and React Native enjoy **huge community and library support**, so finding help or packages for common features is usually straightforward. In terms of recommendation: if your team is more **Google/Android-centric or designers want a custom UI**, Flutter might edge out; if your team consists of **web developers or you prioritize using native UI components**, React Native could be preferable. Both are free and work on all development OSes, so often the decision comes down to language preference and specific project needs.

For organizations entrenched in the **Microsoft/.NET ecosystem**, **.NET MAUI** has emerged as the go-to solution. Its big pros are **one codebase across not just mobile but desktop as well**, and the ability to use C# – a language and runtime your team may already know well. You get native performance and a unified approach to UI with XAML. Another plus is long-term support by Microsoft, which is important for enterprise projects. Cons of MAUI as of 2025 include it being newer – fewer third-party components exist compared to the older Xamarin or to Flutter/RN, and you may encounter some early-stage framework limitations. Additionally, the optimal tooling (Visual Studio 2022) is Windows-centric, so pure Mac or Linux development is not as smooth (although possible). **Xamarin**, which MAUI replaces, should generally be avoided for new projects now – its only remaining role is for legacy app maintenance. If you have an old Xamarin app, the recommendation is to **plan a migration to MAUI** for better support and future-proofing.

In summary, the “best” alternative depends on your scenario:

* **Native-only and modern Android UI**: Choose **Kotlin with Jetpack Compose** for the latest Android-native experience and high productivity.
* **Maintain older Android code or simpler transition**: **Kotlin/Java with XML** might be fine, especially if your team is already comfortable there – though consider gradually adopting Compose.
* **Maximum performance or existing native code**: Use **C++/NDK** (with Android Studio or Visual Studio) sparingly, only for the parts that need it.
* **Cross-platform (mobile)** and fast iteration: **Flutter** is excellent for a unified, high-performance UI and single codebase covering Android/iOS (and more).
* **Cross-platform (mobile) with web/JS synergy**: **React Native** is a strong choice if you want to utilize React and JavaScript skillsets or share code with a web app.
* **Cross-platform (mobile + desktop) in C#**: **.NET MAUI** is recommended for teams with .NET expertise or those migrating from Xamarin, giving you broad reach (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS) with one codebase.
* **Legacy Xamarin**: Only use if maintaining an existing app; for any new development, migrate to MAUI or another modern framework.

By weighing these pros and cons against the project’s requirements and the development team’s skill set, you can select the most suitable Android development approach. Each alternative comes with trade-offs, but the good news in 2025 is that the ecosystem is mature – **whether you go native, cross-platform, or somewhere in between, you’ll find robust tools and community support to build high-quality Android apps**.
